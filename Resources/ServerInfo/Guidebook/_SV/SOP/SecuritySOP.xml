# Security Standard Operating Procedure 
## S-1 Rules of Engagement and Escalation
- An officer shall strive to de-escalate a situation wherever possible, every officer possesses the prerogative to escalate to a level which is fit to contain the issue and control the situation.

Escalation can be summarised into five levels:
- 1. [bold]Presence.[/bold] One or more officer’s presence.
- 2. [bold]Warning.[/bold] A verbal or written warning from an officer.
- 3. [bold]Show of force[/bold]. An officer shows a non-lethal means of force to demonstrate a threat of forceful arrest.
- 4. [bold]Non-lethal means of force.[/bold] An officer uses non-lethal force to arrest a crewmember.
- 5. [bold]Lethal means of force.[/bold] An officer uses lethal force on a crewmember to mitigate immediate damage to life and station.

- If a warning has been given, inform the rest of security and keep record of the warning.
If the offence warned about is repeated, escalation to level 3 or 4 is advised.

- If a person threatens the safety of the station or risk of limb for any crew member on the station, including their own, immediate escalation to level 4 or 5 is advised.

- If non-security personnel holds a non-lethal means of force in their possession and level 3 and below does not get them to stand down, immediate escalation to level 5 is advised.

- A higher alert level means security is given more tools to de-escalate and contain a situation. It’s advised to inform your closest command member to keep the alert levels updated.
