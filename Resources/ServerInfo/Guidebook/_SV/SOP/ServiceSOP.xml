# Hospitality Service Operating Procedure
## H-1 Distribution of Unsafe Products
- Any Service job that deals in serving products, including but not limited to Chefs, Bartenders, and Botanists, should be aware of any potential health complications that may be caused by the products they are serving. If a product is known to be unsafe for consumption for the average person, it may only be served upon request and the requesting crew member must be informed of the associated risks. Failure to do so is considered Endangerment, and the serving staff will be held responsible for any harm caused.

## H-2 Disposal of Fauna
- To reduce the risk of biohazards, janitorial work should include the proper disposal of bodies. Proper disposal includes (but is not limited to) bringing bodies to the Chef to be processed, ejecting bodies into space, and incinerating bodies in a crematorium.
