# Extenuating and Mitigating Factors

## Mitigating
[bold]Duress[/bold]
 - Duress is if they were in personal danger, or someone close to them is in danger, or a significant threat to something significant. Duress means they had absolutely no choice, and the thing to maintain those things is to just do the things they had to. This can often waive any punishment that may be pushed against the defendant, as they had essentially no real choice.

[bold]Emergency[/bold]
 - If it was critical they break a certain law in cases of a clear emergency. This will often waive any punishment pushed against the defendant, but it has to be a clear emergency, and the actions must still be reasonable considering that emergency.

[bold]Remorse[/bold]
 - If the defendant shows clear signs or remorse for one’s actions and a genuine strive to rehabilitate, making it less likely for recidivism. This may also include counseling, since whatever happened it was likely misplaced.

[bold]Self Defence[/bold]
 - This has to be clearly proven. In an attack, they had defended themself to live. It cannot justify actions beyond defending one’s life. If Self Defence can be proven, it may not necessarily, but often will waive the punishment for a crime.

[bold]Co-operation with authorities[/bold]
 - If the defendant had co-operated with authorities in testimonies and reasonable orders, then this is also a mitigating factor.

[bold]Mental Health Issues[/bold]
 - Mental Health issues seen as present enough to sway the actions of the defendant may be considered as a mitigating factor. However, clear documentation should exist before consideration. As well, if the Mental Health issue prevents the client from recidivism, then punishments to heal those should be focused on.

[bold]Aggravated[/bold]
 - If the victim played a part, through their actions or words, in the crime committed against them. These actions must be severe to be properly considered as a mitigating factor.

[bold]Age and Personal Circumstance[/bold]
 - The defendant's age and personal circumstance may be a factor in the punishments. Example being, poor socioeconomic background or bad upbringing. It may reduce culpability.

[bold]Need rather than greed[/bold]
 - The defendant needed to commit this crime, rather than simply out of greed.

[bold]Spur of the moment[/bold]
 - Unplanned and irrational, likely not considering the full consequences. May influence culpability.

[bold]Lack of Prior Criminal Record[/bold]
 - This may see the defendant be seen more favorably as it was an abnormality rather than a pattern of misconduct.

## Extenuating
[bold]Conspiracy[/bold]
 - Clear evidence that this criminal act was properly planned. Indicates a level of separation.

[bold]Recidivism[/bold]
 - If this defendant is showing signs of repeating crimes, indicating they haven’t reformed back into society properly. Recidivism should be punished more harshly.

[bold]Callous Disregard[/bold]
 - If the defendant had cruelly, willingly, and without empathy, acted in a criminal manner.

[bold]Especially Violent[/bold]
 - This crime was especially brutal and abhorrent.
