# Engineering Standard Operating Procedure

## E-1 Building Permits.
- Building permits are mandatory for all major renovations, additions, or for the construction of shuttles. Building permits within departments require approval from that Head of Staff, or the senior-most person in the department if no Head is present. Areas outside of departments (such as Maintenance areas) require approval from the Chief Engineer or Captain.

## E-2 Securing of Atmospherics Tools.
- Engineering staff must return the fireaxe to its locked container when it is not actively being used for a valid reason. Failure to secure the fireaxe constitutes Endangerment.

## E-3 Safe and Secure Burn Chambers.
- Atmospherics Technicians must ensure that all burn chambers they construct are properly reinforced to ensure the chamber maintains its integrity and the burn remains contained.
Burn chambers are to be composed of reinforced plasma or uranium glass, and should be reinforced with grilles whenever possible. Windows used for burn chambers should be full-sized.

## E-4 Station Maintenance.
- While conducting repairs on the station, exterior-facing surfaces should be built from Reinforced Walls unless the resources required to do so are limited or unavailable. Exterior windows should have metal grilles and be composed of reinforced glass. High-Security areas such as the Armory, Telecomms, AI Core, and the Bridge should also be repaired using reinforced walls when possible.

## E-5 Supermatter Maintenance.

- Engineering staff must ensure a Supermatter cooling array is established and active at all times, regardless of the activation status of the Supermatter Crystal This must be done, even if the attending staff do not intend to ‘activate’ the Supermatter Crystal.

[bold]E-5-B[/bold]
- Engineering staff must acquire the Chief Engineer’s permission before utilizing gasses other than Nitrogen or Carbon Dioxide in the cooling array.
