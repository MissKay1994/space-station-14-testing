# Research Standard Operating Procedure

## R-1 Limits of Experimentation
[bold]R-1-A[/bold]
- Self-experimentation is always prohibited. Experimenting on other sophont beings requires a signed liability waiver from both parties and a stamp from the Research Director or Captain. Objects of scientific research (such as Artifacts and Plasmatic Anomalies), along with low grade silicon life are never considered to be sophonts, therefore it is always permissible to experiment on them.

[bold]R-1-B[/bold]
- A ‘sophont’ is categorized as a sentient being that possesses intelligence, consciousness, and adaptability. 
- ‘Intelligence’ is the ability to take in new information, understand it, and react. 
- ‘Consciousness’ is the ability to be aware of one's own existence and empathize with the existence of others. 
- ‘Adaptability’ is the ability to change one's self outside of instruction; to make choices based on the needs of themselves and others.

## R-2 Restricted Technologies
- “Restricted Technologies” refer to all technologies unlocked through the acquisition of a Tier 3 research field, as well as the listed set of lower tier technologies.

- Arsenal: Harm-Packs, Shuttle Armaments, ProtoKinetic Accelerators, PTK-800, ProtoKinetic Accelerator Modkits, Modular Grenade Parts.
- Civilian: Backpack Water Tank, Spray Nozzle, H.O.N.K. Mech.
- Experimental: Force Field Projector, Force Gun, Tether Gun, A.P.E. Units, C.H.I.M.P. Handcannons, G.O.R.I.L.L.A. Gauntlet, Particle Decelerators, Artifact Crushers.
- Industrial: Jaws of Life, Hellfire Heater, Hellfire Freezer, Ripley APLU.

## R-3 Technology Permits
- When distributing restricted technologies to those outside the Science department, permits should be distributed to the person receiving them, regardless of their rank. Permits should specify who the technology is being distributed to as well as the technology distributed. These permits should be stamped by the Research Director, in addition to the Head of Security for technology of the “Arsenal” variety. In the absence of a Research Director, permits should be signed by the research personnel distributing the technology.

## R-4 Artifact Research
- Artifacts should be researched in an airtight and blast resistant chamber. If an artifact is known to have the ability to put the station or its crew in peril, proper safety measures are to be put in place before its activation. Artifacts that are not presently in use should be stored within their chamber or within an artifact container. Artifacts should be kept inside Science, and must be transported within artifact containers when removed from Science unless the Research Director approves of the open carrying of the artifact.

## R-5 Anomaly Management
- If an anomaly poses an undue risk to the crew, it is to be relocated or decayed. It is at the discretion of the Research Director and the affected department’s Head of Staff to dictate what constitutes undue risk. Should the effects of a known anomaly result in the harm or death of a sophont being, the scientist in charge is to be held responsible. Additionally, when there is an imminent threat to the station, anomalous objects should be neutralized.

## R-6 Silicon Operations
[bold]R-6-A[/bold]
- All AI uploading, termination, and law changes must be agreed upon by both the Research Director and the Captain unless the immediate re-lawing, removal, or termination of the AI is immediately required to preserve the safety of the crew.

[bold]R-6-B[/bold]
- If any onboard silicon is not functioning as intended, the danger of this malfunction is to be evaluated by any member of the Science department. If this irregularity is deemed to pose a risk to the crew, operations to rectify this are to be made.

- If a silicon is deemed to be unrepairable, the Research Director and Captain may agree to decommission the silicon in question. In this event, the positronic brain is to be removed from its chassis – or, in the event of it being a Station AI, the intelligence is to be installed into an intellicard – and stored in a safe location. Central Command is to be informed of this issue, and the silicon’s intelligence is to be delivered to Central Command at the end of the shift.
