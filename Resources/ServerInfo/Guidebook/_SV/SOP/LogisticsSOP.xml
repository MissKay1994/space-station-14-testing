# Logistics Standard Operating Procedure

## L-1 Recording of Acquisitions
[bold]L-1-A[/bold]
- Cargo employees are heavily encouraged to maintain records of the materials and items purchased through their department. This record may be written, provided via voice recording, or provided in the form of blue purchasing slips. 

[bold]L-1-B[/bold]
- Orders placed through Cargo are expected to have written reasons associated with the purchase, regardless of which department requisitioned the materials

## L-2 Discretionary Purchasing
- There is not an expectation that all orders are to be unconditionally approved. Cargo employees reserve the right to refuse questionable, unreasonable, or unlawful orders at their own discretion. 

## L-3 Possession of Restricted Equipment
- Regardless of the means of acquisition, all contraband is expected to be processed by Security or disposed of. Processing includes releasing contraband to Security; though a permit may be acquired by Security to facilitate the further use of recovered contraband. Proper disposal includes throwing contraband into deep space, leaving contraband where it was found, or selling it on the Automated Trade Station. 

## L-4 Boarding of Shuttles and Ships
- Salvage is not to board non-derelict shuttles without the explicit permission of Security or Command personnel. Salvage is to immediately withdraw from an inhabited spacecraft upon the discovery of it being a manned craft unless failure to do so would result in an immediate and undue risk of life or limb to the shuttles’ inhabitants.
